Behboud Tech Academy's python course

Here are the two project I di for this course:
1. A book database program which was the class project
   | This one includes the following 3 files:
   | 1. books_app.py  --> The Main File
   | 2. books_info.txt  --> The Database File
   | 3. books_operations.py --> The Functions File
2. A student database program which was the final test of the course
   | This one includes the following 4 (+1) files:
   | 1. menu.py  --> The Main File
   | 2. student_operations.py --> The Function File
   | 3. active_students.txt --> The Active Students Database
   | 4. graduated_students.txt --> The Graduated Students Database
   | There is also a zip file containing all of the above. Don't know why I've uploaded it though...
